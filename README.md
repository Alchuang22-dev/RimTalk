# RimTalk - AI-Powered Dialogue

Bring your colonists to life with RimTalk, a revolutionary mod that uses Google's AI to generate dynamic and context-aware dialogue for your pawns. Gone are the days of repetitive and generic interactions. With RimTalk, every conversation is unique, reflecting the pawn's current mood, thoughts, and situation.

## How it Works

RimTalk integrates directly with Google's AI to generate dialogue in real-time. The mod analyzes a pawn's current thoughts and actions and uses that information to create a prompt for the AI. The AI then generates a line of dialogue that is displayed in a bubble above the pawn's head. This process happens dynamically, creating emergent and immersive conversations that are unique to your colony's story.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Dialogue:** Colonists' speech is generated by the powerful AI, resulting in conversations that are always fresh and interesting.
*   **Context-Aware:** Dialogue is based on what your colonists are doing and thinking, making interactions feel more natural and immersive.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** The AI can generate dialogue in multiple languages, allowing for diverse and culturally rich colony experiences.
*   **Configurable:** You can adjust the frequency of conversations to your liking and even suppress messages that the AI can't process.
*   **Easy to Set Up:** Simply get a free API key from Google AI Studio and paste it into the mod settings.

## How to Get Started

1.  **Subscribe** to the mod on the Steam Workshop.
2.  **Obtain a free Gemini API key:**
    *   Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    *   Click on "Get an API key".
    *   Copy the generated API key.
3.  **Launch RimWorld** and enable the RimTalk mod in the mod list.
4.  **Open the mod settings** for RimTalk.
5.  **Paste your Gemini API key** into the designated field.

That's it! Your colonists will now start having unique and dynamic conversations in their preferred language!

## API Rate Limits (Free Tier)

The mod uses Google's Gemini API with the following free tier limits (as of August 2025):
*   **Requests per minute:** 30 RPM
*   **Tokens per minute:** 15,000 TPM
*   **Requests per day:** 14,400 RPD

For most gameplay sessions, these limits are more than sufficient. The mod is designed to respect these limits automatically.

## Configuration

*   **Gemini API Key:** Your personal key for accessing the Gemini AI.
*   **Talk Interval:** Controls how often colonists will attempt to speak. A lower number means more frequent conversations.
*   **Suppress unprocessed interaction messages:** When enabled, interaction messages that occur too frequently (within the talk interval) and cannot be processed by the AI will be completely hidden instead of showing the original message.

## Compatibility

RimTalk is designed to be compatible with most other mods. It does not alter any core game mechanics and should not conflict with mods that add new pawn types, thoughts, or jobs.

## Troubleshooting

*   **No dialogue appearing:** Make sure you've entered a valid Gemini API key in the mod settings.
*   **Frequent pauses in dialogue:** You may be hitting rate limits. Consider increasing the Talk Interval setting.
*   **API key issues:** Ensure your API key is correctly copied from Google AI Studio without extra spaces.
